# Real-Time Pothole Detection with YOLOv9 and Jetson J40

Author: Julio Gomez

This project uses YOLOv9 for detecting potholes in real-time using a Jetson ReComputer J40. It also captures GPS data and estimates pothole size from video input.

## Features
- YOLOv9 object detection
- Real-time video processing
- GPS coordinates integration
- Pothole size estimation

## Requirements
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€ Main Scripts

### 1. `start_container.sh`

- **What does it do?**
  - Launches a Docker container with GPU for **training tasks**.
  - Installs required dependencies.

- **How to use it?**

```bash
chmod +x start_container.sh
./start_container.sh
```

### 2. `start_realtime.sh`

- **What does it do?**
  - Launches a Docker container with GPU for **real-time pothole detection**.
  - Automatically runs the script `realtime/detect_realtime.py`.

- **How to use it?**

```bash
chmod +x start_realtime.sh
./start_realtime.sh
```
